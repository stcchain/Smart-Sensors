# Smart Sensors

This is where you choose the type of your virtual sensor and how to associate it with a smart contract for the purpose of onboarding it in stcChain.

## Types:

1. Single Variable Sensor (svs.sol)
2. Multi Variable Sensor (mvs.sol)

## Sensor Keys:

Each sensor has its own key pairs in which will be used to insert sensor reading in stcChain.

(Note: Keys are for demonstration purposes and not to be used in production environment!)
